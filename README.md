# Text-Disambiguation


 Text can be disambiguous and thus tough for text processing. So, we use POS tagging and Chunking as one of the methods of diambiguation.
 
 POS Tagging:
    Given a text/corpus, we tag each word of the input with one of the Parts of Speech tag. WSJ corpus is used for tagging. Sequence models(Here MEMM) with Machine Learning is used to predict the tags. MEMM is discriminative model whereas HMM is generative model.
    
Chunking:
   This process is carried out after that tags. This makes chunks/groups of tags and tag them as one. Example: Noun phrase, Verb phrase etc. Sequence Models with Machine Learning is used for chunking.
